This is a packege that help you to encripty passwords and create password for your aplication with security, so in below you can see some methods that can use.

## Installation using composer

in cli:
````
$ composer elevenstack/Gencriptor
````

composer.json file:

````json
    "elevenstack/Gencriptor": "^1.0"
````

## How to use

- getstring_secur(size:int, special_caractere:bool);
- encString(password:string);
- decString(password:string);

Exemple of getpassword();
````php
    require_once __DIR__."venodr/autoload.php";
    use elevenstack\Gencriptor\Gencriptor;

    $pass = new Gencriptor();
    $result = $pass->getstring_secur(8, false);

    echo $result; 
    //G1JCOT7V
````

if you want a method that can undo the security, in first you have use this method 'encString()' to return a password encrypeted and for decrypt the returned password by encString() you have use 'decString()', so thus verifications can be do.

Example of encString(); and decString();

````php
    require_once __DIR__."venodr/autoload.php";
    use elevenstack\Gencriptor\Gencriptor;

    $pass = new Gencriptor();
    $crypted = $pass->encString('anypass');
    echo $crypted;
    //LWVPdi1lT3Z4NEc4JVQ/SDRYa0xuRTNDeDRHOA

    $descrypted = $pass->decString('LWVPdi1lT3Z4NEc4JVQ/SDRYa0xuRTNDeDRHOA');
    echo $descrypted;
    //anypass
````

Example of verification using encpass and decpass: 

````php
    require_once __DIR__."venodr/autoload.php";
    use elevenstack\Gencriptor\Gencriptor;

    $pass = new Gencriptor();
    $crypted = $pass->encString('pass');
    echo $crypted; //LWVPdi1lT3Z4NEc4JVQ/SA

    $descrypted = $pass->decString('LWVPdi1lT3Z4NEc4JVQ/SA');

    if($descrypted == 'pass'){
        echo "Open access";
    }else{
        echo "Error try again";
    }
````
